# CacheTest

### Project description

CacheTest is a module for GNU GRUB environment that measures bandwidth/latency of selective cache levels without OS interference. Selectivity is achieved using strided accesses and verified using CPU performance counters.

The software was used in Intel Haswell CPU cache performance research. The results have been published in the following scientific papers:
